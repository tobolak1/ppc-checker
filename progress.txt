# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-02-13

## Codebase Patterns
- Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router (src/ directory structure)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- TailwindCSS v4 with @tailwindcss/postcss
- Geist font family (Sans + Mono)
- When create-next-app conflicts with existing files, temporarily move them out and restore after

## 2026-02-13 - US-001
- Initialized Next.js project with `create-next-app@latest` (App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ESLint, src dir)
- Updated root page to render "PPC Checker" heading
- Updated metadata in layout.tsx
- Files changed: src/app/page.tsx, src/app/layout.tsx, package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore, tailwind config, postcss config, eslint config
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - create-next-app won't run if ANY files exist in the directory (including untracked ones like .claude/)
  - Need to temporarily move all files out, run create-next-app, then restore them
  - Next.js 16.1.6 was installed (latest at this time), uses Turbopack by default
  - .gitignore from create-next-app already covers .env* patterns
